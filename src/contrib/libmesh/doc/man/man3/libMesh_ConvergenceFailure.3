.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A class representing a solver's failure to converge, to be thrown by 'libmesh_convergence_failure();' This should be a last resort; more often, a solve which has failed should be reattempted after switching to a smaller timestep, adding underrelaxation, taking a smaller continuation step, etc\&.
